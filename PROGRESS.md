# Progress

Read this file first in every session. Update it last, every session — this is
the resumability mechanism across token limits and separate sessions. See the
approved plan at the top of the repo history / conversation for full context;
this file tracks living state only.

## Current status: Phase 0 (Scaffold) — in progress, core pieces done

### Done
- Monorepo: npm workspaces (`packages/*`, `apps/*`), root `package.json` with
  `dev`/`build`/`lint`/`typecheck`/`test` scripts that fan out to workspaces.
- `apps/web`: Next.js 16.2.12 (App Router, TS strict, Tailwind, Turbopack) via
  `create-next-app`.
- Four placeholder packages scaffolded with working `typecheck`/`test` (Vitest)
  scripts, each with a trivial passing test: `@cleartax/tax-engine`,
  `@cleartax/itr-schema`, `@cleartax/filing-provider`, `@cleartax/pdf-form16`.
  Only `tax-engine` has a real dependent so far (itr-schema depends on it,
  filing-provider depends on itr-schema) — wire real code in per their phases.
- Auth: **not NextAuth** — deviated from the plan's suggested library.
  Auth.js (next-auth) v5 is still beta.32 with no stable release, so for a
  single-credential personal-use gate I built a minimal custom session
  instead: `lib/auth.ts` (scrypt password hash/verify, HS256 JWT session via
  `jose`), `lib/rateLimit.ts` (best-effort in-memory login throttle),
  `app/api/auth/login|logout/route.ts`, `app/login/page.tsx`,
  `scripts/hash-password.mjs` to generate `AUTH_PASSWORD_HASH`. Much smaller
  dependency surface for this use case; revisit only if multi-provider auth is
  ever needed (it shouldn't be, per the personal-use scope decision).
- `proxy.ts` (NOT `middleware.ts` — see Next 16 note below) gates every route
  except `/login` and `/api/auth/*`, redirecting unauthenticated browser
  requests to `/login` and returning 401 JSON for unauthenticated `/api/*`
  calls.
- Prisma 7.9.1 wired for Neon: `prisma.config.ts` (new in Prisma 7 — see note
  below) + placeholder `prisma/schema.prisma` (just an `AppMeta` singleton
  model to prove the toolchain works) + `lib/db.ts` using
  `@prisma/adapter-neon` / `@neondatabase/serverless` (with `ws` wired as the
  WebSocket constructor for Node runtimes).
- Security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, nosniff, referrer-policy) added in
  `next.config.ts`. `turbopack.root` set explicitly to kill the multi-lockfile
  warning (there's exactly one lockfile now, at repo root).
- `.env.example` documents every env var needed through Phase 4
  (`DATABASE_URL`, `AUTH_SECRET`, `AUTH_USER_EMAIL`, `AUTH_PASSWORD_HASH`,
  `FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`), validated at runtime via
  `lib/env.ts` (Zod).
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: lint, typecheck, test, build (all with dummy
  env vars), `npm audit --audit-level=critical` (non-blocking — see known
  issue below).
- Verified locally: `tsc --noEmit` clean, `eslint .` clean, `next build`
  succeeds (with dummy env vars), `prisma generate` succeeds.

### Not done yet in Phase 0
- **Never pushed to GitHub / no remote configured.** CI workflow exists but
  hasn't run anywhere yet. Need a GitHub repo + push before CI is real.
- **Never run against a real Neon database.** `prisma migrate dev` has not
  been executed — no Neon project provisioned yet. The Neon adapter wiring in
  `lib/db.ts` is untested against a live connection.
- No commits made yet — working tree is fully staged-able but nothing is
  committed. Do this as part of finishing Phase 0.
- Root `README.md` not written yet.

### Known issues / deferred cleanup
- `npm audit` reports 12 high-severity advisories, all in **dev-only
  tooling** (eslint's transitive `minimatch`/`brace-expansion`,
  `postcss`/build-time). Fixing requires `--force` which bumps eslint to a
  breaking major version — deferred; not a runtime/production risk. Revisit
  when eslint 10 configs are worth migrating to.
- Login rate limiting (`lib/rateLimit.ts`) is in-memory only — resets per
  serverless cold start, so it's a deterrent, not a hard guarantee, on
  Vercel. The real gate is the scrypt-hashed password with timing-safe
  compare. If this ever matters more, move counters to Vercel KV.

## Critical environment notes for future sessions (don't relearn these)

- **This is Next.js 16, not the Next.js in your training data.** Two changes
  that will silently break things if you write "Next 14/15 style" code:
  1. `middleware.ts` is deprecated → use **`proxy.ts`** with an exported
     `proxy` function (same `NextRequest`/`NextResponse`/`config.matcher`
     API, just renamed). Already done at `apps/web/proxy.ts`.
  2. `cookies()`, `headers()`, `draftMode()`, and `params`/`searchParams` in
     pages/layouts/routes are **fully async now** (sync access was removed,
     not just deprecated) — always `await` them.
  3. `next lint` is removed; lint via the ESLint CLI directly (already set up
     as the `lint` script: `eslint`).
  - Full details: `apps/web/node_modules/next/dist/docs/01-app/02-guides/upgrading/version-16.md`
    (also mirrored in `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` in `apps/web/`, which
    `create-next-app` generated — read those docs before writing Next.js code
    if anything seems off vs. what you expect).
- **This is Prisma 7, not Prisma 5/6.** The datasource `url` no longer lives
  in `schema.prisma`. Instead:
  - `prisma.config.ts` at the app root (`apps/web/prisma.config.ts`) holds
    the connection URL for the CLI (`migrate`, `studio`, etc.), loaded via
    `dotenv/config`.
  - The generator is `provider = "prisma-client"` (not `"prisma-client-js"`)
    with an explicit `output` path — we generate to `apps/web/generated/prisma`
    (gitignored, regenerated via `postinstall: prisma generate`).
  - `PrismaClient` at runtime needs a driver **adapter**, not a bare
    connection string — we use `@prisma/adapter-neon`, constructed as
    `new PrismaNeon({ connectionString })` (takes a config object, not a
    `Pool` instance, in this version — check the installed version's
    `dist/index.d.ts` if this ever errors after a bump).
  - Import the generated client from `../generated/prisma/client`, not
    `@prisma/client`.
- Node 24 / npm 11 locally. CI pins Node 22 (still comfortably above Next
  16's Node 20.9+ minimum).

## Next steps (pick up here)

1. Finish Phase 0: write root `README.md`, commit everything, create a GitHub
   repo and push, confirm CI goes green there for real (not just locally).
2. Provision a real Neon Postgres project, put its connection string in a
   local `.env`, run `npx prisma migrate dev` against the placeholder schema
   to prove the Neon adapter path actually works end-to-end, then remove the
   `AppMeta` placeholder model when Phase 4 lands the real schema.
3. Start **Phase 1**: `packages/tax-engine` — AY 2026-27 slabs/rebate/
   marginal-relief/surcharge/cess for both regimes, salary + other-sources
   income only (HRA/house property/capital gains are Phase 2). This is the
   accuracy-critical module — build it, then get an adversarial review pass
   on the boundary-value test suite before moving on. See the plan's Tax
   Computation Engine section for the exact slab numbers and rules to encode.
